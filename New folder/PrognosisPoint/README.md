# HealthCure: An All-in-One Medical Solution
This project will detect seven major diseases under one platform which are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Covid 19 Detection</li>
<li>Brain tumor detection</li>
<li>Breast Cancer detection</li>
<li>Alzheimer detection</li>
<li>Diabetes detection</li>
<li>Pneumonia detection</li>
<li>Heart disease detection</li>
</ul>
It is a revolutionary project as it can detect the disease with a few clicks at home with a good
accuracy and no need to wait for days for the reports. Accordingly, the disease can be treated
quickly. AI is a booming technology and it can do wonders that humans cannot even imagine. This
project will detect seven diseases using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) which will
take input images, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in
the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other. With time, more datasets will be available which will improve the accuracy of this project. This project can be expanded to any number of diseases in the future as well.

# Tools and Technologies
<li>Python - Jupyter Notebook (TensorFlow for Model Training)</li>
<li>Flask Web Framework (for Backend)</li>
<li>Google Firebase (for Real-Time Storage and Firestore Database)</li>
<li>HTML, CSS, and JS (for Frontend)</li>

# Runtime
<b>Python v3.8.10</b>

# Dataset
The dataset for the project was gathered from multiple sources. Two of them are as follows:
1. Chest X-ray images (1000 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
2. CT Scan images (750 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT/tree/master/Data-split

80% of the images were used for training the models and the remaining 20% for testing.
